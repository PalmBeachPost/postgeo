## Get a Google geocoding API key using these instructions:
## https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/get-api-key

## geocachepath is optional, but can help speed things up. You can use a simple "geocache.csv" to create a file in
## the working directory. Or you can set a path for a global location, such as
## "c:\data\postgeo\geocache.csv" and any projects using this will build the cache.

setup = {
    "GoogleAPIkey":"AIzaSyCPp3F7m_6T5rfovxYoICLaBONSICe7hBo",
    "geocachepath":"c:\data\postgeo\geocache.csv"
    }
